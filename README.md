# Visitor Design Pattern
- Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations or behaviors to a set of classes without modifying their structure.
- It separates the algorithm from the objects on which it operates, promoting a clean and extensible design.
- The primary motivation behind the Visitor pattern is to avoid modifying existing classes whenever you need to add new operations or behaviors to them.
- Visitor pattern components:
    1. **Visitor**: The Visitor is an interface or abstract class that defines a set of visit methods, each corresponding to a specific type of element (Visitable). Visitors encapsulate operations or behaviors that need to be applied to various elements in a structured way. By defining a common interface for different operations, you ensure that new behaviors can be added without modifying the existing codebase.
    2. **Visitable**: The Visitable component is an interface or abstract class that declares an **`accept`** method. This method takes a Visitor as a parameter and allows the Visitor to perform an operation on the implementing object. Each concrete element that needs to support visitor operations implements the Visitable interface.
    3. **accept**: The **`accept`** method is declared in the Visitable interface and implemented by concrete elements. This method is used by elements to "accept" a Visitor and let the Visitor perform its operation on the element. Inside the **`accept`** method, the appropriate visit method of the Visitor is called, passing in **`this`** (the current element) as an argument.
    4. **visit**: The **`visit`** methods are defined in the Visitor interface and implemented by concrete Visitor classes. Each **`visit`** method is responsible for handling a specific type of element. These methods are called by the **`accept`** method of the element being visited. The Visitor can extract the necessary information from the element and perform its specific operation.
